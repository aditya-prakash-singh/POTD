# Rotated Array

Problem Description
 
 

Suppose a sorted array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

The array will not contain duplicates.

Note:- Use the circular rotated property of the array to solve the problem.


Problem Constraints
1 <= len(A) <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109


Input Format
The first argument is an Integer array A.


Output Format
Return the minimum element of array A.


Example Input
Input 1:-
A = [7, 2, 4, 5]
Input 2:-
A = [3, 1, 2]


Example Output
Output 1:-
2
Output 2:-

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:-
2 is the minimum element in the aray.
Explanation 2:-
1 is the minimum element in the array.

Note: 
The numbers can be arbitrarily large and are non-negative.
Your answer should not have leading zeroes. For example, 00 is not a valid answer.
DO NOT USE BIG INTEGER LIBRARIES ( WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN JAVA / PYTHON ). We will retroactively disqualify such submissions and the submissions will incur penalties.


Problem Constraints
1 <= |A|, |B| <= 104
1 <= |A| * |B| <= 106


Input Format
The first argument is a string A, representing the first number.
The second argument is a string B, representing the second number.


Output Format
Return a string, equal to the product of A and B.


Example Input
A = "10"
B = "12"


Example Output
"120"


Example Explanation
A = 10 and B = 12, A * B is 120, return it in the string without leading zeroes.
